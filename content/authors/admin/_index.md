Hi, my name is Shijie Chen (陈士杰). I'm a research assistant at the MEDIAN Lab directed by [Prof. Yu Zhang](https://yuzhanghk.github.io/) at Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech) in China. I'm currently interested in natural language processing (NLP) and general machine learning.

I will begin my Ph.D in computer science at Ohio State University (OSU) in fall 2021.
